	William Batterman Ruger (June 21, 1916 – July 6, 2002) was an American firearms designer and entrepreneur, who partnered with 
	Alexander McCormick Sturm to establish Sturm, Ruger & Company in 1949. <br>
	Their first product was the Ruger Standard, the most popular .22 caliber target pistol ever made in the United States. After
	 Sturm’s death in 1951, and under Ruger’s continued leadership, the company produced one of the widest varieties of firearms of any manufacturer in the world.
	<br> Ruger was born on 21 June 1916 in Brooklyn, New York.[1]

	He learned to shoot at age 6, and he received his own Remington Model 12 from his father at the age of 12.[2] 
	He graduated from Alexander Hamilton High School in January 1936.[3] As a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,
	 he converted an empty room into a machine shop and, in 1938 came up with initial designs for what eventually became the experimental 
	 T10/T23E1 light machine gun for the United States Army, executing the drawings on his in-laws’ dining room table. U.S. Army Ordnance
	  officials liked the gun design so much they hired Ruger as a gun designer at the Springfield Armory. <br> Over a 53-year career, Ruger
	   helped invent and patent dozens of models of sporting firearms, which were instant and enduring successes. From the start,
	    his company stressed mechanical innovation and safety. <br>
	
	Ruger shared and exchanged technical information on firearms and ammunition with many like-minded people worldwide, 
	including English rifle maker and cartridge designer David Lloyd. <br>
	
	When not involved with firearms operations, Ruger was deeply involved in a variety of activities, including antique firearms, 
	19th century Western American art, and his nationally noted antique car collection of more than 30 vehicles,
	 including Bentleys, Rolls-Royces, Bugattis, Stutzes, and a 1913 Mercer Raceabout, among others. <br>
	
	Ruger supported and commissioned the design and construction of a classically styled sports touring car in 1970 that he called the 
	Ruger Special. It was based on the design of the 1929 Bentley 4½ Litre. He also designed and commissioned a 92-foot (28 m) yacht, the Titania. <br>
	
	Ruger continued to lead his company on to world prominence in gun manufacturing and it became the largest manufacturer of firearms
	 in the United States. Not only an expert inventor, designer, and engineer, Ruger was also a skilled manufacturer and marketer of firearms. <br><br>
	
	Legacy <br>
Ruger had a hand in the original design and styling of every firearm his company produced. He continued to work on new creations up until his death.
 He led his business from its inception to a corporation listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: RGR). 
 As of 2008 the company had produced more than 20,000,000 firearms for hunting, target shooting, collecting, self-defense, 
 law enforcement and for United States and foreign governments. <br>

Sturm, Ruger has manufacturing plants in Newport, New Hampshire, Prescott, Arizona, and Mayodan, North Carolina, 
and corporate headquarters in Southport, Connecticut. <br> It manufactures rifles, shotguns,
 pistols and revolvers for a variety of sporting and law enforcement purposes. Its precision investment castings are made for a variety of
  industries, including aerospace, automotive, general manufacturing and the golf market. <br><br>

R. L. Wilson, firearms historian and Ruger's biographer, wrote of Ruger: <br><br>

Ruger was a true firearms genius who mastered the disciplines of inventing, designing, engineering, manufacturing and marketing 
better than anyone since Samuel Colt. No one in the 20th century so clearly dominated the field, or was so skilled at articulating the unique 
appeal of quality firearms for legitimate uses.
